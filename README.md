# Tic Tac Toe App

The Tic Tac Toe App is a React application that allows users to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. It provides an interactive game board where players can take turns placing their marks ('X' or 'O') and determines the winner based on the game rules. The project utilizes React's ES6 syntax, TypeScript, and React hooks.

## Features

- Interactive game board where players can place their marks ('X' or 'O')
- Determines the winner based on the game rules (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal matching marks)
- Indicates the current player's turn
- Provides a "Play Again" option to start a new game


## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- CSS: Styling language used to design the app

## Getting Started

To get started with the Course Directory Web App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/liamkande/my-tic-tac-toe-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd my-tic-tac-toe-app`
3. Install the dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Start the application: `yarn start`
5. Open your web browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

Upon launching the application, you will see an empty Tic Tac Toe game board. Players can take turns by clicking on an empty cell to place their mark ('X' or 'O'). The game will automatically determine the winner when there is a matching line of three marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. If the game ends in a draw, it will display a message indicating a tie.

To start a new game after a win or a draw, simply click the "Play Again" button.
